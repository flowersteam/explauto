# Explauto: A library to study, model and simulate curiosity-driven learning and exploration in virtual and robotic agents #

Explauto is a framework developed in the [Inria FLOWERS](https://flowers.inria.fr/) research team which provides a common interface for the implementation of active and online sensorimotor learning algorithms. It was created and is maintained by [Cl√©ment Moulin-Frier](https://flowers.inria.fr/clement_mf/) and [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet).

Explauto provides a high-level API for an easy definition of:

* Virtual and robotics setups (Environment level)
* Sensorimotor learning iterative models (Sensorimotor level)
* Active choice of sensorimotor experiments (Interest level)

It is crossed-platform and has been tested on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Do not hesitate to contact us if you want to get involved! It has been released under the [GPLv3 license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

## Documentation ##

### Scientific grounding ###


Explauto's scientific roots trace back from Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity algorithmic architecture [[Oudeyer, 2007]](http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00793610/en), which has been extended to a more general family of autonomous exploration architecture by [[Baranes, 2013]](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/ActiveGoalExploration-RAS-2013.pdf) and recently expressed as a compact and unified formalism [[Moulin-Frier, 2013]](http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00860641). We strongly recommend to read this [short introduction](http://flowersteam.github.io/explauto/about.html) into developmental robotics before going through the tutorials.

**If you use the library in a scientific paper, please cite** (follow the link for bibtex and pdf files):
